/**
 * Executable evidence for
 * `docs/runbooks/catalog-correction-migration-rollback.md` §B step 3 — the
 * recovery that fills in `WorkAuthor.position`/`Translation.createdById`
 * after a §A/§B window left some rows NULL, restores `NOT NULL`, and only
 * then hands traffic to a version that reads these columns as required.
 * `RECOVERY_SQL` below is quoted VERBATIM in the runbook: if it ever changes
 * here, the runbook's copy must change identically, or the two have diverged.
 *
 * What this specifically proves, on real migration-shaped data on a scratch
 * database (never the shared `_test` one or dev):
 *
 * - recovery is ONE transaction that locks writers out first, waits for an
 *   already-in-flight writer to finish, fills the NULLs, restores `NOT
 *   NULL`, and only then commits — no window where a fresh writer can slip
 *   a new NULL row in between "filled" and "required again";
 * - a manually reordered `position` (not alphabetical — modelling a future
 *   8e-2 PATCH reorder) survives recovery untouched, both for the rows that
 *   already had a position and for the ones that didn't;
 * - a NULL row added during the §A/§B window is appended after the existing
 *   max position, not spliced in, and not re-sorted against the manual order;
 * - the `CatalogRevision` audit row and `Work.revision` are untouched;
 * - once the transaction commits, the REAL generated `PrismaClient` — the
 *   same one `catalog.mapper.ts` uses — reads the affected rows without
 *   throwing, which is the actual "safe to open traffic to the new version"
 *   signal, not just "no NULL left" by raw SQL count.

 * §B step 3 of the runbook, as ONE transaction — the exact text an operator

 * 1. `LOCK TABLE ... IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE` — blocks every other writer
 *    AND reader of these two tables, and itself blocks until any
 *    transaction already holding a conflicting lock (an in-flight writer)
 *    commits or rolls back. This is "stop writers and wait for their
 *    transactions to finish" as one SQL primitive, not a separate manual
 *    step an operator has to get right on their own.
 * 2. Creator recovery — safe to re-run any number of times: the
 *    `WHERE ... IS NULL` guard means it only ever fills a gap, never
 *    overwrites a `createdById` that is already set. Same text as the
 *    `BACKFILL:CREATOR:*` block in
 *    `20260910231627_catalog_correction_audit_schema/migration.sql`.
 * 3. Position recovery — deliberately NOT the original migration's blanket
 *    `BACKFILL:POSITION:*` query (which recomputes every row from scratch
 *    and would overwrite a manual reorder): this one only assigns a
 *    position to rows where it is still NULL, appending them after the
 *    work's current highest position — same role → name
 *    (`COLLATE "uk-x-icu"`) → authorId order the original backfill used —
 *    and never touches a row that already has one.
 * 4. Restore `NOT NULL` — in the SAME transaction, still holding the lock,
 *    so no writer can slip a fresh NULL row in between "filled" and
 *    "required again". `COMMIT` is the only point traffic may resume.
