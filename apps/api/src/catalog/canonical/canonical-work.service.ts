 * §6.3, stage 7h: resolving a `Work` id to the record that answers for it.
 *
 * A merged `Work` is never deleted (§6.3) — it keeps `mergedIntoId` while all of
 * its `Edition`, `Translation`, `Review` and `WishlistItem` rows move to the
 * target. Without this resolver a link to a merged work would render an empty
 * page: the title survives, everything under it is gone.
 *
 * Resolution is a single lookup, not a loop, and that is not an optimisation —
 * it is invariant R4, held by `merge.service.ts` on the write side:
 * `assertMergeable` refuses a merge whose source or target is already merged,
 * and `incomingMergesRepointed` rewrites every incoming `mergedIntoId` to the
 * new target. So `mergedIntoId` always names a canonical work, and a chain
 * longer than one hop cannot be created in the first place. Walking a chain here
 * would be dead code that quietly licenses the invariant to rot.
