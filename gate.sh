# --- Git hygiene ------------------------------------------------------------
# Whitespace errors, in every place they can hide: unstaged tracked changes,
# staged changes, and untracked text files (§ below). `docs/specification.md`
# must never change (CLAUDE.md) — checked against HEAD so a *staged* edit is
# caught too, not just an unstaged one.

git diff --check
git diff --cached --check

# Untracked files aren't covered by `git diff`, and staging them for the check
# would touch the real index. `git diff --no-index` compares two paths without
# touching the index at all. Comparing against /dev/null always reports a
# "difference" (exit 1), so the exit code can't distinguish "clean" from
# "has whitespace errors" here — only `--check`'s own output can. Binary files
# are handled correctly by the same mechanism: git detects them and prints
# "Binary files differ" instead of running the whitespace check, so this loop
# never reads binary content as text.
